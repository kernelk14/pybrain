# PyBrain
A different take on BrainFudge (yk know what language do I mean here)

## Quick Start

Clone this repo then,

if you are in Windows (which I'm not):
```console
C:\User\user> python main.py 
```
if you are in Linux/Unix:
```console
$ ./main.py
```
in Linux/Unix, i already made the code executable without calling python3.

## Why did u did this?
| Actually I don't know, maybe i'm bored.
